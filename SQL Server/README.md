# 🧠 SQL Server Practice Repository

This repository contains a structured collection of **SQL Server scripts and exercises**, developed as part of my ongoing practice and refinement of data manipulation, querying, and modeling techniques using **T-SQL**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to maintain a well-organized space for practicing and optimizing SQL Server capabilities in real-world contexts. The scripts simulate business scenarios and cover a wide range of use cases — from simple queries to more advanced logic used in analytics and reporting solutions.
